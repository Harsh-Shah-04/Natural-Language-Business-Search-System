# Backend — M1.1 (Atlas + FastAPI spike)

Scope of this milestone only: prove the MongoDB Atlas index configuration
works before any real data or ML code depends on it. No business logic,
no ingestion, no embedding model yet — those are M1.2/M1.3.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   cd backend
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Create a free MongoDB Atlas M0 cluster** (no credit card required):
   - Sign up / log in at https://cloud.mongodb.com
   - Create a new Project, then a new Cluster on the **M0 (Free)** tier
   - Database Access -> add a database user with a password
   - Network Access -> add your current IP (or `0.0.0.0/0` for local dev only)
   - Once the cluster is up: Connect -> Drivers -> Python -> copy the connection string

3. **Configure environment:**
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Paste your connection string into `MONGODB_URI`, and set `DB_NAME` (default `business_search` is fine).

4. **Create the two Atlas indexes:**
   ```
   uv run python scripts/create_atlas_indexes.py
   ```
   Reads `scripts/atlas_indexes/*.json`, creates `business_vector_index` (Vector Search)
   and `business_search_index` (Search) via the pymongo driver, and waits until both
   are queryable. Safe to re-run — skips indexes that already exist.

   **Manual fallback** (if you'd rather use the Atlas UI): Atlas Search tab -> Create
   Search Index -> JSON Editor. The JSON Editor only wants the index *definition* —
   Index Name, Database, Collection, and Index Type are separate UI fields, not part
   of the pasted JSON. Select `business_search` / `businesses`, then create Index 1
   (Type = Vector Search, Name = `business_vector_index` — exact name, the app looks
   it up by this string) pasting `vector_index.json`, and Index 2 (Type = Search, Name
   = `business_search_index`) pasting `search_index.json`.

## Run

Start the API:
```
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Check it's up: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` -> `{"status":"ok"}`

Verify the Atlas spike (both indexes actually work end-to-end):
```
uv run python scripts/verify_atlas_spike.py
```
Expected output: `PASS: both $vectorSearch and $search found the test document`

## Field naming convention

The dataset's xlsx columns map to snake_case document fields going forward
(`business_description`, `products_services`, `keywords`, `specialties`, etc.) —
established here since the search index definition needs concrete field names,
and M1.2's ingestion script will follow the same convention.

## Notes

- Embedding dimensionality (384) is defined once in `app/constants.py`. The
  Atlas vector index's `numDimensions` in `scripts/atlas_indexes/vector_index.json`
  can't import that constant (it's plain JSON) — keep them in sync by hand if
  the embedding model ever changes.
- `verify_atlas_spike.py` retries each index query briefly before failing, since
  Atlas Search/Vector Search indexes update asynchronously after a write — an
  immediate query can miss a just-inserted document even with a correctly
  configured index.
- Common first-run failure: `bad auth : Authentication failed` usually means the
  connection string's username is still the literal `<db_username>` placeholder
  from Atlas's template — check Database Access in the Atlas UI for the actual
  username and swap it in.
